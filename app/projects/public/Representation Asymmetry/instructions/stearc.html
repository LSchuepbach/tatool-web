<h1>"Days of the week" task</h1>
<h2>Practice trial</h2>

<p>For the first task, you will see a day of the week written in the center of the screen. You will
	have to tell whether this day is in next (future) or previous (past) two days.</p>

		<tr>
			<td style="padding:10px; background-color:#e7e7e7; text-align:center">Press the <strong>left
					arrow key</strong> if the day is in the <strong id="leftA"></strong>. <br> <br>

			</td>
			<td width="25"></td>
			<td style="padding:10px; background-color:#e7e7e7; text-align:center">Press the <strong>right
					arrow key </strong>if the day is in the <strong id="rightA"></strong>. <br>
				<br> <img src="key_arrow_R.png">
