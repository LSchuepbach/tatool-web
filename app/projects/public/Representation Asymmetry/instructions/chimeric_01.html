<div id="tatoolFormat">
<h1>Chimeric face task</h1>

<p>Now comes a quite different task. You will see two faces, one above the other.
	Your task is easier than it seems:</p>

<h2>Which face seems happier ?</h2>

<p>Don't worry too much what could be a right or wrong answer. We are more interested by your gut feeling.
	Also don't take too much time to answer (max. 5 seconds)</p>

<p>Press the up key on your keyboard if the face above seems happier,
	press the down key if the other one seems happier.
	You can also answer with your mouse.</p>



<p class="center">
	<br>Please press the <span class='highlight_red'>right
		arrow key </span> to start the task.
