<div id="tatoolFormat">
<h1>Days of the week task</h1>
<h2>Run 1/4</h2>

<p>You did <span id="count"></span>% correct</p>
<!-- Add condition specific instruction -->

<p>Now the real task is coming. It's all the same, except you now have a shorter time to answer. This might seem short, but it is usually enough to answer correctly. If you concentrate on the task, it should go well.</p>

<p>Everything will be repeated a few times. That's normal, it's to make sure
	what we measure is stable (that's why distractions disturb your results).
	If you make some mistake, don't worry too much but just continue the task on a good pace. It doesn't last very long.</p>



<p class="center">
	<br>Please press the <span class='highlight_red'>right
		arrow key </span> to start the task.
