<h1>Days of the week task</h1>

<p>For the first task, you will see a day of the week written in big. You will
	have to tell whether this day is in next or previous two days.</p>
<!-- Add condition specific instruction -->

<p>Everything will be repeated a few times. That's normal, it's to make sure
	what we measure is stable (that's why distractions disturb your results).
	Just continue the task on a good pace. It doesn't last very long.</p>

<p>Please answer as fast as you can, while still answering correctly</p>

<p class="center">
	<br>Please press the <span class='highlight_red'>right
		arrow key </span> to start the task.
